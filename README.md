🎬 SpotMySeat — Real-Time Movie Ticket Booking App

SpotMySeat is a real-time movie ticket booking web application designed to handle high-concurrency seat selection. It ensures that multiple users cannot book the same seat at the same time by implementing a seat-locking mechanism using Firebase transactions / real-time updates.

🚀 Features

✅ Browse Movies & Show Timings
✅ View Seat Layout (Available / Locked / Booked)
✅ Real-Time Seat Locking (No Double Booking)
✅ Secure Booking Confirmation
✅ User Authentication (Login / Signup)
✅ Booking History (Optional)
✅ Mobile Responsive UI

🧠 Problem it Solves

In traditional ticket booking systems, if two users select the same seat simultaneously, both may think they booked it.

SpotMySeat solves this by:

Locking seats in real time

Preventing other users from selecting locked seats

Confirming seats only after successful payment/booking simulation

🛠️ Tech Stack
Frontend

React.js

JavaScript

CSS / Tailwind CSS (based on your UI)

Backend / Database

Firebase Firestore (Real-time Database)

Firebase Authentication

Firebase Transactions (Seat Lock System)

🔒 Seat Locking System (Core Logic)

SpotMySeat uses a real-time locking concept:

📌 When a user selects a seat:
✅ Seat status becomes LOCKED for that user
✅ Other users immediately see it as unavailable

📌 When the booking is confirmed:
✅ Seat status becomes BOOKED permanently

📌 If user leaves / timeout:
✅ Seat lock can be released (optional enhancement)
